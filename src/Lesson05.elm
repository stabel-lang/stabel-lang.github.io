    # '>Coordinate' is a word that requires two Ints to be on the stack, and will create a Coordinate with those numbers as x and y, respectively.
    # '>x' and '>y' requires an Int and a Coordinate to be on the stack, and sets the x/y member to the provided Int.
    # 'x>' and 'y>' will return the x/y value of a Coordinate, which must be on the stack.

    # The '>' character can be read as 'into'. 
    # '>x' is then read as 'into x' and 'x>' is read as 'x into'. 
    # Either you're reading from the stack and into x, or from x into the stack.

    # Do note that '>' and '<' is not special syntax, but can be used in the name of any word.
