                <h3>Minimal, yet flexible, syntax</h3>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>The syntax of Play is based on Forth, resulting in a syntax which could fit on a postcard while still being flexible enough for anything you need. All functions (what we call 'words') are implicitly composable, and so Play programs are a concatination of words just like books.</p>

                    <pre class="shell">
                        def: main
                        : 1 inc
                          2 =

                        def: inc
                        : 1 +

                        def: dec
                        : 1 -
                    </pre>
                </div>
            </article>

                <h3>Easy to reason about</h3>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>Play uses a static type system with type inference, which lets you rule out bugs while it staying out of your way. In addition, all data structures are immutable, greatly reducing the number of states your program can be in and which you must account for when writing code.</p>

                    <pre class="shell">
                        Compilation failed:

                        2 | def: main
                        3 | type: -- Int
                        4 | entry: true
                        5 | : 1 2

                        The type of 'main' is specified to be  -- Int.
                        However, it seems that the actual type is:  -- Int Int

                <h3>Portable</h3>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>Play is compiled to web assembly. This allows Play programs to execute in a browser in addition to on the command line, and to work the same no matter where it is executed. The alternative to web assembly would be to compile to javascript, but then we'd have to live with a legacy which includes 53-bit integers and six different falsy values.</p>

                <h3>In Alpha</h3>

                <p>Play is still in early development. There are currently no strings, arrays or even garbage collection. All of this will come in time.
